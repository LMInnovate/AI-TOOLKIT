# Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow â€“ MNIST Digit Classification 

##  Overview

This task involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal was to achieve over **95% accuracy** on the test set and visualize predictions.

---

##  Objectives

- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- Design and implement a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- Visualize predictions on 5 sample images.
